Python script which creates an interactive character sheet

First commit uploaded version alpha 1.0 to repo.
Worked on alpha 1.0 prior to creating this github acocunt.  Alpha 1.0 contains no bugs but also does not containe error exceptions.
Furthur work on this solo project will be commited to this repo and any future projects will be done the same.

Thank you for your patience and understanding!
